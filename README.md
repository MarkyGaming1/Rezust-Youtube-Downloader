How to Use (For End Users)

Navigate to the Releases tab at the top of this page.

Download the latest .zip package (e.g., Rezust.Downloader.v1.0.zip).

Extract it to a folder of your choice. The folder structure will look like this:

Rezust Downloader/
|
|-- YoutubeMp3Downloader.exe  <-- RUN THIS
|-- YoutubeMp3Downloader.exe.config
|
|-- bin/
    |
    |-- (ffmpeg.exe needs to go here)
    |-- (all the .dll files are in here)


IMPORTANT: Get FFmpeg 

"FFmpeg.exe" IS ALREADY IN RELEASE 

The program requires ffmpeg.exe for MP3 conversion and for merging high-quality (720p+) MP4 videos.

Go to: https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/

Download the release-essentials.zip package.

Unzip the file, find the bin folder inside it, and copy the ffmpeg.exe file.

Paste the ffmpeg.exe file into your program's bin subfolder (next to all the .dll files).

Run YoutubeMp3Downloader.exe and enjoy!

Disclaimer (Project History)

This project was created through an iterative collaboration between GitHub user @MarkyGaming1 and an AI (Google Gemini).

The project idea, specifications, testing, and final fine-tuning came from the human user. A significant portion of the C# code, bug fixes, optimizations, and feature expansions were generated by the AI based on the user's real-time feedback and requests.

This repository serves as an example of how human creativity and AI-driven code generation can be effectively combined to build a complete desktop application.
